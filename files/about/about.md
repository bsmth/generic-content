### Our Journey

From our beginnings to becoming the go-to resource for web developers worldwide,
here's how we've evolved:

- #### 2005

  Launched as
  [DevMo by Mozilla](https://blog.lizardwrangler.com/2005/02/23/devmo-and-devedge-updates/),
  a community-driven wiki dedicated to documenting open web standards.

- #### 2010

  Rebranded as
  [Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2010/08/introducing-the-new-mdn-website/),
  reinforcing our commitment to the developer community.

- #### 2017

  Achieved a milestone when major tech companies began contributing and
  supporting web documentation on our platform, solidifying MDN as the central
  hub for web development knowledge.

- #### 2020

  Transitioned from its wiki-based origins to a modern,
  [GitHub-hosted project](https://github.com/mdn) with the launch of Yari,
  modernizing our infrastructure and workflows.

- #### 2022

  Unveiled a
  [major redesign](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2022/03/a-new-year-a-new-mdn/) and
  introduced
  [MDN Plus](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2022/03/introducing-mdn-plus-make-mdn-your-own/),
  offering personalized features for an enhanced user experience.

- #### 2023/2024

  Launched new tools, including Playground for coding experiments, AI Help for
  easier content discovery, and HTTP Observatory for website security scans. We
  also introduced a Blog to cover interesting topics beyond MDN’s core focus,
  and a Curriculum to provide a structured approach to learning web development.

We had fun exploring the
[internet archives](https://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000*/developer.mozilla.org)
and putting together a fast-forward trip through our transformation!
